mathproof
==============================

We explore the application of transformer-based Language Models (LM) to automated theorem proving. We specifically use a GPT-3 based neural network fine-tuned on mathlib code to generate math sequences. Our LMs acts as an automated prover and proof assistant. We further combine couple of language models and re-ranker to select for the best results. Overall this improves the results from 0.322 to 0.3627 for out GPT-3 based ADA model and 0.4592 for our combined GPT-3 and GPT-NEO model. Our github code is on.

# Data


A large part of our code involves and build upon the work done at OpenAI. We further go a  step ahead and add all the packages heres. 

You can download the files with the proceesed data from the link below.

```

```

We use the following Libraries to help us with out code. All our data is prepared in the  folder and processed. All the data can be downloaded with the link above. The code takes a while to run therefore download it from the link above.

The libraries which help our code are:
```

https://github.com/jesse-michael-han/lean-step-public.git

```


# Model

As discussed in the model, we have three different models. The first is the GPT-3 model which is a fine-tuned model on the mathlib code. The second is the GPT-NEO model which is a model which is trained on the mathlib code. The third is the combined model which is a combination of the GPT-3 and GPT-NEO model and reranked. The combined model is the best model for our project. 

Please check the GPT-3 Folder under src/gpt3/ for how to train the model.




### OpenAI Training 


OpenAI uses their own platform for fine tuning. We use command line application called `openai` to train the model. The command line application is available in the link below.


We will first have to download the package
```
pip install openai
```

Then set your OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable by adding the following line into your shell initialization script (e.g. .bashrc, zshrc, etc.) or running it in the command line before the fine-tuning command:
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```


Unzip the folder in data/processed/ for the data. We will have the prepare the data in the following way:
```
openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f data/processed/files_upload/data_test.jsonl
openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f data/processed/files_upload/data_train.jsonl
openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f data/processed/files_upload/data_valid.jsonl
```

It will generate the following files:
* data_test_prepared.jsonl
* data_train_prepared.jsonl
* data_valid_prepared.jsonl


We finally train our model using the following command:
```
fine_tunes.create  -t  data/processed/data_train_prepared.jsonl -v data/processed/data_valid_prepared.jsonl -m  ada 
```
The code will train an model and give you a fine tuning id. Store the finetune id and use it to get the model.
```

We train an ada model feel free to change your model to babbage, curie or davinci.

Check your results of the fine  tuning by running the following command:
```
openai api fine_tunes.follow -i <finetuneid>
```

Our resuls were:

```
openai api fine_tunes.follow -i <finetuneid>
```
