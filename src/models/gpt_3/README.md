# OpenAI Training 


OpenAI uses their own platform for fine tuning. We use command line application called `openai` to train the model. The command line application is available in the link below.


We will first have to download the package
```
pip install openai
```

Then set your OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable by adding the following line into your shell initialization script (e.g. .bashrc, zshrc, etc.) or running it in the command line before the fine-tuning command:
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```


Unzip the folder in data/processed/ for the data. We will have the prepare the data in the following way:
```
openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f data/processed/files_upload/data_test.jsonl
openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f data/processed/files_upload/data_train.jsonl
openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f data/processed/files_upload/data_valid.jsonl
```

It will generate the following files:
* data_test_prepared.jsonl
* data_train_prepared.jsonl
* data_valid_prepared.jsonl


We finally train our model using the following command:
```
fine_tunes.create  -t  data/processed/data_train_prepared.jsonl -v data/processed/data_valid_prepared.jsonl -m  ada 
```
The code will train an model and give you a fine tuning id. Store the finetune id and use it to get the model.
```

We train an ada model feel free to change your model to babbage, curie or davinci.

Check your results of the fine  tuning by running the following command:
```
openai api fine_tunes.follow -i <finetuneid>
```

Our resuls were:

```
openai api fine_tunes.follow -i <finetuneid>
```
